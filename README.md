A project using Python to merge, analyze, flag, and create visuals for the topic of how gun laws impact different areas of the US. Initially, the project was only meant to analyze the relationship between gun laws and crime; later on other metrics like gun sales and guns per capita were also included. With crimes being analyzed at a county level and gun laws being made at a state level, as well as the human bias inherent in some of our data, it is difficult if not impossible to separate out all the potential confounding variables, and so the results shown here should be taken with a grain of salt and more fine-grained analysis is needed. However, some interesting trends were able to be uncovered and, in the pursuit of reducing violent crime, we may have some more worthwhile trees to bark up in the future.
