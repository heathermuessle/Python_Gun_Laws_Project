A project using Python to merge, analyze, flag, and create visuals for the topic of how gun laws impact different areas of the US. Initially, the project was only meant to analyze the relationship between gun laws and crime; later on other metrics like gun sales and guns per capita were also included. With crimes being analyzed at a county level and gun laws being made at a state level, as well as the human bias inherent in some of our data, it is difficult if not impossible to separate out all the potential confounding variables, and so the results shown here should be taken with a grain of salt and more fine-grained analysis is needed. However, some interesting trends were able to be uncovered and, in the pursuit of reducing violent crime, we may have some more worthwhile trees to bark up in the future. 
Presentation of results can be found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/heather4386/viz/Unit6Project_16795059772210/Story1. Note that this is not every result uncovered in the entire analysis, only the results that were the most useful. 

Gun laws by state were found here: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NACJD/studies/37363/versions/V1
Various datasets on crime rates by state, county, etc. were taken from the FBI's website here: https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019
The JSON file used for different US counties was found here: https://github.com/millbj92/US-Zip-Codes-JSON
Gun sales data was found from the ATF here: https://www.atf.gov/resource-center/data-statistics
